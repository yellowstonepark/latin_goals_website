            <h2>Embrace Every Moment</h2>
            <p>“Claim yourself for yourself, and gather and save the time which until now was either taken away or stolen or slipped away. Some moments are snatched from us, some are stolen, some slip away. However, the most shameful loss is that which happens through negligence. Reflect on how you use your time daily, for a large part of life slips away for those doing nothing, and the entire life for those doing something other than what they ought.”</p>

            <h2>Value Your Time</h2>
            <p>“Who will place some value on time, who evaluates a day, who understands that he dies every day? We often mistake and look forward to death, not realizing that a large part of it has already passed. Whatever time has gone by is held by death. Therefore, my Lucilius, embrace all hours and rely less on tomorrow by taking hold of today. Each moment is precious and irreplaceable, and even the most grateful cannot repay the time taken.”</p>

            <h2>Act Wisely</h2>
            <p>“While life is postponed, it runs on. All things, Lucilius, are another’s, only time is our own. Nature has given us the possession of this one fleeting and slippery thing, which anyone can expel us from. Such is the foolishness of mortals that they allow themselves to be charged for things that are minimal and worthless, yet no one considers himself in debt when he has taken up another’s time. Embrace the present, plan your goals, and act wisely, for it is too late to be sparing when you are at the bottom of the barrel.”</p>
